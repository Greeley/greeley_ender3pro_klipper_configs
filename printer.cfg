#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
max_extrude_only_distance: 100.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or

#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not have any impact on normal printing moves. If not

#   have.
pressure_advance: 0.00192217
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during

#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the

#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended

control: pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must

pid_Kp: 21.527
#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must

#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
#min_extrude_temp: 170
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 250
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller

[fan]
pin: PA0
#   Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#kick_start_time: 0.100
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first
#   enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
#   spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#off_below: 0.0
#   The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a
#   value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
#   requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be
#   used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
#   effective. The default is 0.0.
#
#   This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted.
#   To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
#   fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest
#   input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
#   off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for
#   example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
#tachometer_pin:
#   Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally
#   required. This parameter is optional.
#tachometer_ppr: 2
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per
#   revolution of the tachometer signal. For a BLDC fan this is
#   normally half the number of poles. The default is 2.
#tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0015
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the
#   tachometer pin, in seconds. The default is 0.0015, which is fast
#   enough for fans below 10000 RPM at 2 PPR. This must be smaller than
#   30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the
#   maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.

#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 3000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel_to_decel: 1500
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.
max_z_velocity: 5
#   This sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of movement along the z
#   axis. This setting can be used to restrict the maximum speed of
#   the z stepper motor. The default is to use max_velocity for
#   max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel: 100
#   This sets the maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of movement along
#   the z axis. It limits the acceleration of the z stepper motor. The
#   default is to use max_accel for max_z_accel.

#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center X, Y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0, 0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
#mesh_min:
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular

#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max:
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3, 3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.

#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0

#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position

#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.

#   this to False. The default is True.
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
#x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#y_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
#z_offset:
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.#speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples:
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist:
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#samples_result:
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance:
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries:
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.

#[extruder_stepper my_extra_stepper]
#extruder: extruder
#   The extruder this stepper is synchronized to. If this is set to an
#   empty string then the stepper will not be synchronized to an
#   extruder. The default is "extruder".
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
